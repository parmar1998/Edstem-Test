Contact management System.
 Simple REST APIs will help the user to do following actions
- Creating a USER.
- Deleting a user iD by his/her phoneNumber
- getting all the contacts in your System more like a Phone Directory.

  Following Dependencies were used in making the REST API
  - Sprig Data JPA - JPA Repository to achieve different CRUD operations
  - MYSQL as DB.
  - Spring WEB - for handling the request
  - Org.hibernate validator for validating the data i.e phoneNumber(should be unique) and Name(should not be blank)
  - Spring Dev tools - for live reloading
 
  - I used postman as client for testing the APIs.
